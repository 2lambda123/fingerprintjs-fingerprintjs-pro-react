in the `.env.local`. You can just copy `.env` file located in this directory.

More info about the API key you can find on the [documentation page](https://dev.fingerprintjs.com/docs/js-agent#agent-initialization).

### Installing dependencies
1. Go to the root of the project, install dependencies with `yarn install` and build it with `yarn build`.
2. Come back to the example folder (`cd examples/next`) and run `yarn install`.

After you've completed all the steps and inserted the API key, you can run:
```shell
yarn dev
```
