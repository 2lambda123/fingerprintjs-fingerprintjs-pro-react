This example demonstrates the usage of Fingerprint Pro inside the Next.js `pages` directory (classic approach).

## Setting up
To try out this example, you need to get your public API key first.
You can find more information about the API key [in our documentation](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/js-agent#agent-initialization).

1. In the example folder copy `.env` file to the new one `.env.local`.
2. Set up your public API key in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FPJS_PUBLIC_API_KEY` variable.
3. In the root folder install dependencies with `yarn install` and build it with `yarn build`.
4. In the example folder run `yarn install`.

After you've completed all the steps and inserted the API key, you can run:
```shell
yarn dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) to view it in the browser.
